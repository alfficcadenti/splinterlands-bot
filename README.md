# splinterlands-bot

This is my personal project of a BOT to play the game [Splinterlands](https://www.splinterlands.com). It requires [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/it/download/) installed to run.


## index.js

run `npm install`

to start BOT login routine. username and password needs to be specified in the file .env (file with no name, only starting dot to create a hidden file) in the root as variable like:

- `ACCOUNT=youraccountname`
- `PASSWORD=yourpostingpassword`
- `MATCH_INTERVAL=match interval in minutes, 30 by default` 

run `node index.js`


## battlesGetData.js

[ OPTIONAL ] run `node battlesGetData.js`

The BOT leverage an API but in case doesn't work, it is possible to have locally an history as a backup.
To generate the file 'history.json' with a unique array with the history of the battles of an array of users (to be specified in the file).

input data for future model:

- _mana_cap_: the total mana that can be selected
- _ruleset_: rules applied for the match (to be explored)
- _inactive_: type of monster card that are not available for the match. important for the summoner selection (first card)

_Example_: `[{"summoner_id":178, "summoner_level":1, "monster_1_id":174, "monster_1_level":1, "monster_1_abilities":[ ], "monster_2_id":172, "monster_2_level":1, "monster_2_abilities":[ ], "monster_3_id":169, "monster_3_level":1, "monster_3_abilities":[ ], "monster_4_id":"", "monster_4_level":"" "monster_4_abilities":"", "monster_5_id":"", "monster_5_level":"", "monster_5_abilities":"", "monster_6_id":"", "monster_6_level":"", "monster_6_abilities":"", "created_date":"2020-02-21T00:51:30.717Z", "match_type":"Ranked", "mana_cap":13, "ruleset":"Back to Basics", "inactive":"Green,Black,Gold", "battle_queue_id":"a137a7b662bdb182069a8a13f36071ed14a4a6d9", "player_rating_initial":596, "player_rating_final":617, "winner":"a14"],...}`


# FAQ


Q: Can I make the bot running a battle every 2 minutes?
A: Technically yes, but playing too often will decrease the Capture Rate making the rewards very low and insignificant. Try to play a battle every 20 minutes MAX to maintain high level of rewards. Trust me, you keep the ROI higher. Don't be greedy.

Q: Does it play for the daily quest?
A: At the moment the bot consider only the splinters quests (death, dragon, earth, fire, life, water) but not the special one (snipe, sneak, neutral,...). Therefore yes, the bot prioritize the splinter for the quest. Nonetheless if the bot consider more probable to win a battle with another splinter (because for example there are not many possible team for the splinter of the quest), you may see a different card selection sometimes

Q: Can I play multiple accounts?
A: Technically yes, but don't be greedy.

Q: I got the error "cannot read property split of undefined"
A: check that the credentials file doesn't contain any but ".env" in the name. (no .txt or anything else) and check that there is nothing but ACCOUNT=yourusername and PASSWORD=yourpass in 2 lines with no spaces. Also you must use the username with the posting key, and not the email address.

Q: Why the bot doesn't use my best card I paid 1000$?
A: Because the bot select cards based on the statistics of the previous battles choosing the most winning team for your cards. it's a bot, not a thinking human being!

Q: Why the bot doesn't use the Furious Chicken?
A: same as above
